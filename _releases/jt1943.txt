JT1943 FPGA clone of 1943 arcade faithful to original hardware
==============================================================

Please, read the main README file too.

You have just got an expensive $500 PCB according to eBay. You have in your hands
a faithful conversion of the circuits on the 1943 PCB to FPGA. If you come from
the emulation world here are some of the things different from emulators:

-Real CPU/GPU bus sharing with delays
-Sprites handled with DMA exactly as in the original hardware
-Palettes determined by the original PROMs
-Graphics priority handled by the original PROM
-No lag between image and input. Data is being sent to the screen in real time.
-3 button input (although the game seems to use only two buttons)
-Sound sampling rate: 41.663 kHz (original, 125/3 kHz)

These technical aspects mean that the game play will be different from an emulator
in a number of ways and that some hardware tricks that were not emulated will work
here as in the original hardware.

GAME PLAY
=========

It is obvious what you have to do except:

-Press fire 1 and 2 to roll
-Hold the coin button during power up to test mode in order to be
 able to access al test options
-Hold fire 1 at the end of an air carrier phase to receive a weapon at the
 beginning of the next phase
